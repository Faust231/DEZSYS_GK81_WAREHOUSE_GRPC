# DEZSYS_GK81_WAREHOUSE_GRPC

gRPC: Is a high-performance RPC framework by Google, working across languages/platforms due to protocol buffers.

RPC Life Cycle: Client sends request, server processes it, and sends back response.

Protocol Buffers Workflow: Define types/services, compile to code, use for serialization.

Benefits of Protocol Buffers: Efficient, language/platform agnostic, supports versioning.

When Not Recommended: Not for small/simple projects.

Data Types in Protocol Buffers: Integers, floating-point numbers, booleans.
